    <p style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ACADEMIC PROJECT</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong> IMAGE CAPTION GENERATOR: </strong> In this project, we will take a look at an interesting multi modal topic
            where we will combine both image and text processing to build a useful Deep Learning application, aka
            Image Captioning. Image Captioning refers to the process of generating textual description from an image â€“
            based on the objects and actions in the image.</li><br>
        <li><strong> EMOJIFY : </strong> We will implement a model which inputs a sentences and finds the most appropriate
            emoji . our algorithm will be able to generalize and associate words in the test set to the same
            emoji even if those words don't even appear in the training set. This allows ous to build an
            accurate classifier mapping from sentences to emojis, even using a small training set.</li>
